# DIY Kata

This repository is aimed at helping you get to grips with the basics of testing in JavaScript. 

Your challenge is to populate the functions and then to write tests for those functions.

## Instructions

Fork this repository and clone down your fork.

Change into the cloned folder, and add you and your partner's remotes to you your local.

Run `npm install` to install the necessary libraries required for Node.js to run.

There are two folders: `/src` and `/__tests__`. Both contain JS files named numerically. Start on the first file in `/src` and find the matching file in `/__tests__`. On the curriculum materials on GitLab, you will find requirements that correspond to each one, explaining what the expected behaviour of each function should be, and what you should be asserting against in your tests. There is also a walkthrough for the first one, just to give you a bit of practice.

Once you've completed each function/test pair, run `npm test -- yourFunctionName` inside your cloned repo to check if your tests have worked.

Add, commit, push and swap pairing roles after each one. When you've done them all, both partners should create pull requests to this repository.
